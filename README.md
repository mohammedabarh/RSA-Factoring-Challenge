# RSA Factoring Challenge

## Overview

This project aims to factorize numbers into two smaller factors, which can be used in the RSA encryption breaking process. The program reads a file containing natural numbers and attempts to find two factors `p` and `q` for each number such that `n = p * q`.

## Requirements
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Python 3.x

## Usage

To factorize numbers from a file:

```bash
python3 factors.py <file>
